Voyager is an open source rewrite of IBM OS/2

Hello there, Eris Blastar here, my brother Orion and I decided to save this branch of the Voyager because the original site it was hosted on had errors.
This is the last known version that kind-of-sorta just works, an alpha test that you can tinker with. It only has the CLI part as the Desktop source code was password protected as was the source code for the media manager. We ask how it can be 100% open sourced when 2/3rds of the OS is password protected from the public? The Free Software Foundation ought to hear about that!

This is a complete and total rewrite of IBM's OS/2 that does not use any IBM or Microsoft code. Since OS/2 had over 300+ third party code snippets IBM could not open source it.

My brother Orion has started an OS/2 subreddit on Reddit:

Please feel free to talk about OS/2 and open source rewrites there.
