Hacking ORBit2
==============

	Please log all patches/bug-reports bugzilla.gnome.org and get
approval from myself (Mark) or Michael before committing.

	If you don't think bugzilla is appropriate, send a mail to
orbit-list@gnome.org.

	If you don't receive any feedback within a resonable number of
weeks, go ahead and commit, but please CC the list as you commit.

Coding Style
============

	No code that does not work is accepted into ORBit2 - ie. the
half finished feature you meant to implement - it's not going in. We
have enough unused clutter without more.

	Code that gets committed must be correct, it must look
beautiful, it must have an elegant control flow, it should have
complete regression tests that couple to make check - to prove that it
works.

	Indentations are 8 stops, as are tabs. Code layout should use
K&R - and distribute the extra whitespace to make the code pleasant to
read. Methods should be short, use _ naming not stdlycaps and be sweet
- not try to do too many things.

	Patches should be in diff -u format, and come complete with a
dated ChangeLog in the standard form ( cf. emacs C-x 4-a ).

					Michael Meeks - 9/10/2001

	Build sheriff commits are welcome - in accordance with the
relevant build sheriff constraints.

	Members of the GNOME packaging product may commit fixes to
the .spec files.
