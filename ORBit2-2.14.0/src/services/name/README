This is a full CORBA-compliant CosNaming-service.

It is using hash tables (courtesy of glib) for the contexts and should
be fairly fast.

USAGE:

The name server outputs its IOR upon startup to sdtout. 

To use the name server together with the name client, you can do
something like the following

orbit-name-server >/tmp/name-service-ior

then you can test it with the name-client prog, which should be
fairly self explanatory.

with the name-client you can also query the gnome name server by using
the option --gnome. This will take the name server id from the X11
root window property CORBA_NAME_SERVICE

TODO:

- maybe implement the new CosNaming and CosNamingExt-modules.
  See ftp://ftp.omg.org/pub/docs/orbos/98-10-11.pdf
  That means removing the LName-thing again. 

- make the contexts persistent in some way.

- create a new POA for the NameServer. Which properties should it have
  then ??? should be sorted out together with the persistence issue, it
  seems.

- shortcut the resending of the requests, if the contexts live in the
  same server. This should speed up things additionally.

DONE:

- make the exceptions really work like specified, i.e. set
  "NotFoundReason why", "Name rest_of_name" and "NamingContext cxt" to
  appropriate values.

- why does list return Names and not NameCompoments ?
  ( I asked on comp.objects.corba and the answer was
    something like: "because they didn't really think about it" )

- use hash tables instead of arrays.
