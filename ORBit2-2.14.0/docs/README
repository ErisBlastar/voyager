This directory contain various documentation documents in various stages of 
completion. The documentation is mainly directed at ORBit2 hackers, not 
developers using ORBit2 in their applications.

You should go to the ORBit2 homepage to get developer documentation. A 
recommended read is the "ORBit Beginners Documentation" which can be reached 
at:

    <http://www.gnome.org/projects/ORBit2/orbit-docs/orbit/book1.html>

The beginners guide has lots of sample code to get you started. 

You can also take a look at a more involved ORBit2 application, the Brutus 
ORBit2 sample application. This application will demonstrate access to a 
Microsoft Exchange server using ORBit2 and Brutus. Brutus is a CORBA wrapping 
of Extended MAPI. Go to:

    <http:/www.omesc.com/>

to download the latest Brutus tar-ball and look in "brutus/idl/samples/C".
