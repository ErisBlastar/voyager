linc is a library that eases the task of writing networked servers & clients. It
takes care of connection initiation and maintainance, and the details of various
transports. It is used by the new ORBit to handle message transmission/receipt.

Currently supported transports:
	IPv4 (tested)
	UNIX domain sockets (tested)
	IPv6
	IrDA

The connections can optionally be encrypted using OpenSSL.

zlib support is planned for compression.
Subclassing LINCConnection/LINCServer for handling specific protocols (such as IIOP
in ORBit's case) is currently a bit icky and needs to be fixed.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send bug-reports or patches.
