** Idle I/O thread setup
	+ Can we setup the I/O thread idly in either
		a) CORBA method dispatch from non-main thread
	or	b) a servant binding with non-default policy.
	+ This would solve our API/ABI compat issues (?)

linc-connection.c
	+ ** Emitted signals must do threadsafe object refs **
	+ cnx deref lock -> ref count lifecycle.

	+ always disconnecting -> disconnected ?
	+ on read/write also take lock ...
		+ linc_connection_wait_state change (internal?)
			+ [ - wait for disconnected / connected etc. ? ]
		+ write can try to write (with lock) for a bit

** TODO:
	+ push cnx_get_status method through ORBit2
	+ Need a linc test that certainly fills a socket
	  buffer on write in threaded mode ...

	+ global cross thread condition / task queue thing ?
		+ shutdown
		+ callback mechanism for 'broken' etc. ?

** Older thoughts:
	+ create (linc_connection_initiate) [ take lock ]
	+ linc_connection_state_changed     [ take lock ]
		+ assert happened in the I/O thread ...
		+ During construction this bit hooks it into the
		  polling loop - must be done in the main loop (!)
		  [ or must it ? - special case for construction ? ]
		+ signal the connections' condition ...
