		<para>For years the book <citetitle pubwork="book">The Design of
			OS/2</citetitle> <citation>Kogan92</citation> was recommended by
			programmers as a reference for everyone who wanted to write an operating system.
			The book gave an insight into the design of a modern operating system at the time
			but was still easy to read for not that experienced programmers.</para>
		
		<para>This book tries to provide the same for <quote>The Voyager Project</quote>,
			an attempt to create an object oriented workplace for the 21th century. The
			ultimate goal is to make it easy for new programmers to join the project. This book
			will give you a starting point for that.</para>
