  <title>About this Book</title>

  <section id="dov.appb.tu">

    <title>Technologies Used</title>

    <para>This book is written using XML based 
    <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">DocBook</ulink> syntax. We 
    decided to use DocBook because it allows one to create various 
    output out of it like XHTML, PDF and more if necessary. We use a 
    XML DTD called <quote>DocBook XML V4.3</quote>.</para>

    <para>The content was written using 
    <ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</ulink> with 
    <ulink url="http://www.xmlbuddy.com">XMLBuddy</ulink> and 
    <ulink url="http://vex.sf.net">Vex XML Plugin</ulink> on a Linux 
    System. A port of Eclipse to eComStation and OS/2 is in the 
    works.</para>

    <para>Graphics are done in Inkscape and OpenOffice and imported as 
    PDF or PNG into the XML document, in the future SVG will be used as 
    well.</para>

    <title>Contributing</title>

    <para>There are numerous ways to contribute to this book:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>

        <para>Correct the text. Most people writing on this book are 
        not native English speakers so contributions in that regard are 
        always welcome.</para>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>

        <para>Help us on doing the graphics. We are not graphic 
        designers so it might be easy for you to create prettier 
        graphics. We need them in SVG, PDF and PNG format. It would be 
        good if there is a consistent look and feel of the icons and 
        symbols used.</para>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>

        <para>Write/contribute to (missing) chapters. It is not 
        possible for us to finish this book alone so every help on 
        technical details is appreciated!</para>

      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Before you start working on something get the latest version 
    of the book first and contact us as well on the mailing-list. We 
    need any help we can get but it would be a waste of time to 
    duplicate work! See FIXME for more details about how to get in 
    contact with us.</para>

    <para>If you work on the XML files make sure the format of the XML 
    file is not changed if possible, otherwise we get very big 
    changesets in Subversion which does not really help maintaining it. 
    If you are in doubt send the XML file to one of the Subversion 
    commiters to reformat it.</para>

    <title>Getting the XML Source</title>

    repository at netlabs.org. You can get it with any Subversion 
    client, for example the command-line version:</para>

    <synopsis>
svn checkout
